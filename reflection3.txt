I have created an account in GitHub, time to test the remote git operation

or it would be better to say " HELLO GITHUB !!"

I would want the pull to be manual so that conflicts do not arise

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?


Fork is getting a copy of a repository on GitHub which is now assigned to my account on the cloud

Clone is getting the copy of the repository from github or from a repository on my local machine  to my local machine

branches is creating a safe path for experimentation kepping my main trunk untouched


I would collaborate using a tortise SVN
